## 1. Design Phase
- **Definition**: A stage in the software development process where system specifications are translated into a software architecture and design.

## 2. Determine the List of Quality Requirements
- **Explanation**: Involves identifying and listing essential criteria that the software product must meet to satisfy customer expectations and ensure reliability, usability, and efficiency.

## 3. Drawback of Code Coverage Measurement
- **Concern**: While code coverage is a useful tool for identifying untested parts of a codebase, it doesn't guarantee the quality or effectiveness of tests and can lead to a false sense of security.

## 4. Requirements Traceability
- **Definition**: The ability to trace and link requirements through the stages of development to ensure they are addressed and to facilitate impact analysis of changes.

## 5. Software Design
- **Explanation**: The process of defining software solutions to problems, including the structure, components, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

## 6. Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) Paradigm
- **Concept**: A strategy used in software engineering for defining and interpreting operational goals using quantitative measures. It involves setting goals, formulating questions that reflect those goals, and choosing metrics to answer the questions.

## 7. Organization Measures
- **Context**: Metrics used by an organization to assess its performance, effectiveness, and efficiency in achieving its objectives. These can include financial, operational, and quality measures.

## 8. Cohesion
- **Definition**: A measure of how closely related and focused the functionalities within a single module or component of software are.

## 9. Downtime
- **Meaning**: The period during which a system, service, or application is not operational or accessible, often due to maintenance or technical issues.

## 10. Depth in Tree (DIT)
- **Explanation**: A metric in object-oriented programming that indicates the number of levels a class is from the base class in the inheritance hierarchy. A higher DIT value can imply greater complexity and potential for reuse and polymorphism.
